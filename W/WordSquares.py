'''
Given a set of words (without duplicates), find all word squares you 
can build from them.

A sequence of words forms a valid word square if the kth row and 
column read the exact same string, where 0 â‰¤ k < max(numRows, numColumns).

For example, the word sequence ["ball","area","lead","lady"] forms a 
word square because each word reads the same both horizontally and 
vertically.

b a l l
a r e a
l e a d
l a d y
Note:
There are at least 1 and at most 1000 words.
All words will have the exact same length.
Word length is at least 1 and at most 5.
Each word contains only lowercase English alphabet a-z.

Example 1:

Input:
["area","lead","wall","lady","ball"]
Output:
[
[  "wall",
   "area",
   "lead",
   "lady"
],
[  "ball",
   "area",
   "lead",
   "lady"
]
]


Explanation:
The output consists of two word squares. The order of output does not 
matter (just the order of words in each word square matters).

Example 2:

Input:
["abat","baba","atan","atal"]
Output:
[
[ "baba",
"abat",
"baba",
"atan"
],
[ "baba",
"abat",
"baba",
"atal"
]
]


Explanation:
The output consists of two word squares. The order of output does not 
matter (just the order of words in each word square matters).
