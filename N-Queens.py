-Hard-
*Backtracking*
The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n√ón 
chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement,
 where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.

 

Example 1:


Input: n = 4
Output: [[".Q..","...Q","Q...","..Q."],["..Q.","Q...","...Q",".Q.."]]
Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above
Example 2:

Input: n = 1
Output: [["Q"]]
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 9
