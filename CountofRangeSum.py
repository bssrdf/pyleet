'''

Given an integer array nums, return the number of range sums that lie 
in [lower, upper] inclusive.
Range sum S(i, j) is defined as the sum of the elements in nums between
indices i and j (i â‰¤ j), inclusive.

Note:
A naive algorithm of O(n2) is trivial. You MUST do better than that.

Example:

Input: nums = [-2,5,-1], lower = -2, upper = 2,
Output: 3 
Explanation: The three ranges are : [0,0], [2,2], [0,2] and their respective 
sums are: -2, -1, 2.
