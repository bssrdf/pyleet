Given an integer d between 0 and 9, and two positive integers low and high as lower and 
upper bounds, respectively. Return the number of times that d occurs as a digit in all 
integers between low and high, including the bounds low and high.
 

Example 1:

Input: d = 1, low = 1, high = 13
Output: 6
Explanation: 
The digit 
d=1
 occurs 
6
 times in 
1,10,11,12,13
. Note that the digit 
d=1
 occurs twice in the number 
11
.
Example 2:

Input: d = 3, low = 100, high = 250
Output: 35
Explanation: 
The digit 
d=3
 occurs 
35
 times in 
103,113,123,130,131,...,238,239,243
.
 

Note:

0 <= d <= 9
1 <= low <= high <= 2Ã—10^8
Hints
Define a function f(x) to get the requested sum from 1 to x. So the answer will be f(hi) - f(lo - 1)
In order to solve f(x) we need to do a DP over digits approach.
